Introduction:- Every living thing in the world needs access to water to survive. Research shows that while we can last three weeks without food, we cannot go three days without water. Studies show that around 66% of the Earth is made up of water, with only 1% of that water being fresh or useful and the rest being saline or salt water. Even though water is necessary for our survival, some water, like ocean water, cannot be consumed. Even while contaminated water is causing health problems for individuals all throughout the world, but this article has focus on India. India is one of the nations that has many health problems since the water is unsafe to consume. • According to a United Nations (UN) statistic, over 1.5 million individuals every year pass away and polluted water is to blame for 80% of health issues in underdeveloped nations.

• Each year, 2.5 billion illnesses and 5 million fatalities are reported. A nation's prosperity and wealth are largely dependent on its access to water. However, one of the new issues in the modern world is the significant decline in water levels during the past few decades.

• According to the World Health Organisation, 97 million Indians, second only to Chinese citizens, lack access to clean drinking water. The World Bank calculates that 21% of infectious infections in India are caused by filthy water.

 Objective:- • The main objective of the project is predicting the quality of water.

• Project also aims a reliable, affordable, consumer oriented and sustainable potable water supply and sanitation services.

• The system will help reduce people’s consumption of poor-quality water and consequently curtail horrific diseases such as typhoid and diarrhea.

• To understand what constitutes safe, potable water and distinguish between potable and non-potable water by applying machine learning techniques.

• In this case, our application can improve water pollution in different water bodies.

• Due to health issues, we want to ensure that water is clear, lacks salt, free of odor and flavor ,free of chemicals and so on.
